# Exercise 7: Numerical Data Processing

Like in Exercise 5, you will be using Jupyter Notebooks in this exercise. Here is a quick guide to refresh your memory on how to use them.

## Running Jupyter Notebooks
### From CLI
The first option is to run a jupyter notebook from the command line. You can do this by first installing jupyter notebooks using pip.

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Then you can run one of the following commands to start a jupyter notebook server.

```bash
python -m notebook
```
```bash
python3 -m notebook
```
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Lastly, in the web interface, navigate to the directory where the notebook is located and open it.

See the [official documentation](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for more information.

### In VSCode
First, you have to install the Jupyter package with pip and the Jupyter extension in VSCode.
You then have to select a kernel for the notebook. This is either your Python interpreter or a virtual environment where you have the jupyter package installed. You can do this by clicking on the kernel selector in the top right corner of the notebook, or try to run a cell and select a kernel when prompted.

See the [official Visual Studio Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) for more information.

### In PyCharm
Jupyter Notebooks are only supported in the Professional edition. As a student, you can [get this edition for free](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students).

Make sure you have the Jupyter package installed in your Python interpreter. You can then just open the notebook file in PyCharm and run the cells.
